Project for Databases CSCI-SHU 213

The objective of this course project is to provide a realistic experience in the design process of a relational database and corresponding applications. We focus on conceptual design, logical design, implementation, operation, maintenance of a relational database. We also implement an associated web based application to communicate with the database (retrieve information, store information etc).
